%% B-A Scale-Free Network Generation and Visualization
% *By Mathew Neil George*

%% Description and Cautions
% The *SFNG* m-file is used to simulate the B-A algorithm and returns scale-free
% networks of given node sizes. Understanding the B-A algorithm is key 
% to using this code to its fullest. Due to Matlab resource limitations, it may not be
% possible to generate networks much larger than 15000 nodes, and increasing the
% *mlinks* variable increases processing time severely. This code was
% developed so that one could generate a network of small size, and then
% use that network as a seed to build a greater sized network, continuing
% this process until the actual desired network size is reached. This is for
% processor and time management purposes. However, realize that the initial
% seed does not have to have scale-free properties, while the later seeds
% may happen to have these properties. Therefore, it is prudent not to make the
% initial seed size much larger than a few nodes (most commonly 5
% interconnected nodes). In addition, the *mlinks* should be kept constant
% throughout the creation of the scale-free network.
%
% The *PLplot* m-file takes a scale-free network in adjacency matrix format
% and draws a best fit line to the frequency of degrees distribution of the
% nodes. Degree is the number of links that connect to and from a single node
% For scale-free networks, the frequency of degrees distribution forms a 
% power-law curve, with an exponent usually between -2 and -3. This code is
% designed to allow only non-zero frequencies to be graphed in log-log format.
% The function returns the equation of the power-law fit in a cfit variable.
%
% The *CNet* m-file function creats a network graph using the *gplot*
% function with circular coordinates. It allows for a simple, yet
% intuitive, visualization of a given network.

%% Parameters
% *SFNG*
%
% * *Nodes* is the desired network size, including the seed network size
%   (i.e. Nodes minus seed network size equals the number of nodes to be
%   added).
%
% * *mlinks* controls the number of links a new node can make to the existing
%   network nodes.
%
% * *seed* is the original network to which the B-A algorithm links
%   additional nodes with a specific preferential attachment procedure.
%   This undirected adjacency matrix can be created manually, or one could
%   use the *Adjacency Matrix GUI*. Each node must have at least one link.
%   The *seed* variable can be replaced with a developed scale-free network
%   to generate a larger one. Make sure the new *Nodes* variable is greater
%   than the size of the *seed* network.
% 
% *PLplot*
%
% * *Net* is the input network which is to be graphed.
%
% *CNet*
%
% * *Net* is the input network which is to be graphed.
%
% Note that variables *Nodes*, *mlinks*, and *size* must be whole numbers and 
% variables *seed* and *Net* must be undirected adjacency matrices. The 
% diagonol elements of any adjacency matrix used with these functions must
% all be zero.

%% Sample Output
% Here is a small example to demonstrate how to use the code. This code
% creates a seed network of 5 nodes, generates a scale-free network of 300 nodes from
% the seed network, and then performs the two graphing procedures.
seed =[0 1 0 0 1;1 0 0 1 0;0 0 0 1 0;0 1 1 0 0;1 0 0 0 0]
Net = SFNG(300, 2, seed);

PL_Equation = PLplot(Net)
CNet(Net)
