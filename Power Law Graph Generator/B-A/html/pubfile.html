         <h2>Description and Cautions<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>The <b>SFNG</b> m-file is used to simulate the B-A algorithm and returns scale-free networks of given node sizes. Understanding the B-A algorithm
            is key to using this code to its fullest. Due to Matlab resource limitations, it may not be possible to generate networks
            much larger than 15000 nodes, and increasing the <b>mlinks</b> variable increases processing time severely. This code was developed so that one could generate a network of small size,
            and then use that network as a seed to build a greater sized network, continuing this process until the actual desired network
            size is reached. This is for processor and time management purposes. However, realize that the initial seed does not have
            to have scale-free properties, while the later seeds may happen to have these properties. Therefore, it is prudent not to
            make the initial seed size much larger than a few nodes (most commonly 5 interconnected nodes). In addition, the <b>mlinks</b> should be kept constant throughout the creation of the scale-free network.
         </p>
         <p>The <b>PLplot</b> m-file takes a scale-free network in adjacency matrix format and draws a best fit line to the frequency of degrees distribution
            of the nodes. Degree is the number of links that connect to and from a single node For scale-free networks, the frequency
            of degrees distribution forms a power-law curve, with an exponent usually between -2 and -3. This code is designed to allow
            only non-zero frequencies to be graphed in log-log format. The function returns the equation of the power-law fit in a cfit
            variable.
         </p>
         <p>The <b>CNet</b> m-file function creats a network graph using the <b>gplot</b> function with circular coordinates. It allows for a simple, yet intuitive, visualization of a given network.

% seed does not have to have scale-free properties, while the later seeds
% may happen to have these properties. Therefore, it is prudent not to make the

%% Parameters
% *SFNG*

%   The *seed* variable can be replaced with a developed scale-free network
%   to generate a larger one. Make sure the new *Nodes* variable is greater
%   than the size of the *seed* network.
