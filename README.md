# Seqential-quadratic-programming-on-manifold
sequential quadratic programming on Riemannian manifold

The code for the paper <Sequential quadratic optimization for nonliear optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds>

It needs Manopt - can be downloaded here:https://www.manopt.org/

The code is based on the one found on https://github.com/losangle/Optimization-on-manifolds-with-extra-constraints
