# Seqential-quadratic-programming-on-manifold
The code for the paper ''Sequential quadratic optimization for nonlinear optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds'' [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07153).

It needs Manopt - can be downloaded [here](https://www.manopt.org/). Part of code is from [Optimization-on-manifolds-with-extra-constraints](https://github.com/losangle/Optimization-on-manifolds-with-extra-constraints/blob/master/README.md).
